I am originally from São Paulo, Brazil, but I was mainly raised in [Florianópolis](https://wikitravel.org/en/Florianopolis), an amazing island in the South of my country. I have graduated at [UFSC](https://ufsc.br/). Just before graduation I got the opportunity to study one year at [École Nationale Supérieure des Mines de Nantes] (https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_nationale_sup%C3%A9rieure_des_mines_de_Nantes), currently known as [IMT Atlantique](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/en) in France. After college, I studied contaminated site assessment, receiving my Ms.C. from [Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto](https://ufop.br/) on Environmental Geology. I am now a environmental specialist at [ArcelorMittal Brasil](http://brasil.arcelormittal.com.br/). Prior to that, I was an associate at [COBRAPE](http://www.cobrape.com.br/).

My [research](https://profiles.impactstory.org/u/0000-0002-8082-1890) focused on health-related applications of Natural Language Processing-based methods, and was funded by the National Institutes of Health, the Oregon Clinical and Translational Research Institute, and Autism Speaks. I have written numerous scientific [publications](/publication) on autism and neurodevelopmental disorders and have presented my research at over 25 international conferences.

While at OHSU, I became an avid user of the statistical programming language R, both in the lab as a Principal Investigator and in the classroom as a professor. I developed a passion for programming and education, and during my tenure at OHSU I developed and taught multiple graduate-level [data science courses](/categories/course/) and [workshops](/categories/workshop/). I also trained the [Office of Research Impact at the Oregon Clinical & Translational Research Institute](https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/research/centers-institutes/octri/) to use R, and consulted with the University of Oregon College of Education on the development of a [graduate data science specialization track](https://education.uoregon.edu/). I received an [Excellence in Education award](https://www.ohsu.edu/school-of-medicine/honors-and-awards-ceremony-2018-school-medicine) from OHSU in 2018.

You can follow my current work for [RStudio Education on GitHub](https://github.com/rstudio-education). In my free time, I love spending time with my family and my two-year-old daughter. Thank you so much for reading.
