I am an Environmental Specialist at ArcelorMittal Brasil, where I work at the corporate office trying to help our sites to implement actions to towards our company Sustainable Goals. My responsibilities include water management, environmental site assessment, circular economy, life cycle assessment, environmental product declaration and radioprotection.

I really enjoy performing data analysis and also to define strategies to deploy projects which aim to enhance sustainable business practices. 

I have been practicing capoeira for more than 20 years and currently I work on a social project which aims to educate children through this cultural manifestation. 

On my spare time, I love trekking, take care of my pets (dogs, bunnies and chicken) and learning new culture.
